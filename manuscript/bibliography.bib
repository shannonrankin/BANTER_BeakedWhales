	abstract = {Cetaceans spend most of their time below the surface of the sea, highlighting the importance of passive acoustic monitoring as a tool to facilitate understanding and mapping their year-round spatial and temporal distributions. To increase our limited knowledge of cetacean acoustic detection patterns for the east and west coasts of Gwaii Haanas, a remote protected area on Haida Gwaii, BC, Canada, acoustic datasets recorded off SG̱ang Gwaay (Sep 2009–May 2011), Gowgaia Slope (Jul 2017–Jul 2019), and Ramsay Island (Aug 2018–Aug 2019) were analyzed. Comparing overlapping periods of visual surveys and acoustic monitoring confirmed presence of 12 cetacean species/species groups within the study region. Seasonal patterns were identified for blue, fin, humpback, grey and sperm whale acoustic signals. Killer whale and delphinid acoustic signals occurred year-round on both coasts of Haida Gwaii and showed strong diel variation. Cuvier’s, Baird’s, beaked whale and porpoise clicks, were identified in high-frequency recordings on the west coast. Correlations between environmental factors, chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature, and cetacean acoustic occurrence off Gwaii Haanas were also examined. This study is the first to acoustically monitor Gwaii Haanas waters for an extended continuous period and therefore serves as a baseline from which to monitor future changes.},

	abstract = {Although sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) are distributed throughout the globe, their behaviour and vocal repertoire are poorly described. We used passive acoustic monitoring to describe the vocal behaviour of sei whales in the Falkland Islands, between December 2018 and April 2019. We isolated more than 2000 low-frequency calls for manual classification, of which 510 calls with high signal-to-noise ratio were quantitatively measured. Five categories of stereotyped call types in the 15–230 Hz range were described, some with multiple subcategories. These included some similar to previously described calls (e.g. downsweeps), but others that were novel in acoustic structure and frequency band. In the mid-frequency range, we documented a highly stereotyped, hierarchically structured and rhythmically repetitive song display. Songs were arranged in phrases with a structure composed of repetitive sub-phrases, and a diverse variety of sounds in the 1–5 kHz range. Singing commenced in late February, despite the presence of whales and calls since early December, and continued through April. These acoustic properties and behavioural characteristics indicate that this is likely a male breeding display similar to songs and singing of other balaenopterids. This is the first detailed description of a song display for sei whales, highlighting the importance of the Falkland Islands.},

	abstract = {In the Southern California Bight, the common dolphin Delphinus delphis is the most abundant dolphin species and preys upon small pelagic fish, mesopelagic fish, and cephalopods. Mesopelagic fish and many cephalopods are available throughout the year, and they form deep scattering layers, some of which characteristically undergo strong diel vertical migrations. The extent of vertical migration depends on the degree of sea surface solar and lunar illumination. At their daytime depth, mesopelagic prey are beyond the range of shallow-diving dolphins. Autonomous acoustic recorders were used to monitor dolphin echolocation at 2 offshore recording locations from 2009 to 2014. Manual and automated classification techniques were used to identify periods of high echolocation activity, indicative of common dolphin foraging. Clear lunar patterns existed in cool months, when echolocation activity was highest during the darkest periods of the night and lunar month, indicating times when dolphins were foraging, possibly on mesopelagic prey. Echolocation was more abundant during warm months, but diel and lunar patterns in echolocation were weaker. Generalized additive mixed models show that the observed patterns in echolocation activity are correlated with lunar day and position of the moon in the night sky. Seasonal patterns may represent geographic shifts in common dolphin populations, shoaling scattering layers, or prey switching behavior during the warm months, whereby dolphins target small pelagic fish not associated with the deep scattering layers. Overall, dolphin foraging activity declined from 2009 to 2014 during warm months, which may be related to a declining abundance of small pelagic fish.},

	abstract = {Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are highly social Arctic toothed whales with large vocal repertoires and similar acoustic profiles. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) that uses multiple hydrophones over large spatiotemporal scales has been a primary method to study their populations, particularly in response to rapid climate change and increasing underwater noise. This study marks the first acoustic comparison between wild belugas and narwhals from the same location and reveals that they can be acoustically differentiated and classified solely by echolocation clicks. Acoustic recordings were made in the pack ice of Baffin Bay, West Greenland, during 2013. Multivariate analyses and Random Forests classification models were applied to eighty-one single-species acoustic events comprised of numerous echolocation clicks. Results demonstrate a significant difference between species’ acoustic parameters where beluga echolocation was distinguished by higher frequency content, evidenced by higher peak frequencies, center frequencies, and frequency minimums and maximums. Spectral peaks, troughs, and center frequencies for beluga clicks were generally {\textgreater} 60 kHz and narwhal clicks {\textless} 60 kHz with overlap between 40–60 kHz. Classification model predictive performance was strong with an overall correct classification rate of 97.5\% for the best model. The most important predictors for species assignment were defined by peaks and notches in frequency spectra. Our results provide strong support for the use of echolocation in PAM efforts to differentiate belugas and narwhals acoustically.},

	abstract = {Defining the appropriate scale over which to conduct a study in the marine environment is critical to achieving appropriate scientific, management, mitigation and conservation objectives. This paper focuses on applications of passive acoustic technologies over a range of spatial and temporal scales. It is divided into sections dealing with archival and real-time passive acoustic sensor applications. Each section assesses the principles behind using the respective technology and provides recent examples of research and management applications for marine mammals and fish. The section on archival sensors highlights the need for continued development of automated acoustic detectors to assess large data sets. Case studies are presented of detectors developed for determining seasonal occurrence and distribution of haddock sounds and humpback whale vocalizations. Also presented are studies of other applications using archival sensors: tracking singing humpback whales in Brazil, using vocalizations to assess the reproductive strategies of Arctic bearded seals and assessing regional variability in call patterns for North Atlantic right whales. The section on real-time passive acoustic sensors focuses on real-time buoys and towed arrays. Case studies presented include a real-time buoy system used for monitoring endangered North Atlantic right whales and a stationary autonomous array providing real-time access to Antarctic acoustic data. The value of using towed arrays for real-time applications is also assessed, and a case study is provided on the use of towed arrays to improve abundance estimates of North Pacific cetaceans and to better understand vocalization behaviors.},

The beaked whales are among the deepest and longest diving of all marine mammals, and they can dive to depths of several thousand meters and remain under water for an hour or more to feed on deep water squid, fish, and to a lesser extent crustaceans. Adult males of most species have a single pair of tusks used in aggressive male–male combat, and in general, juveniles and females are functionally toothless.

These complex vocalisations span a broad range of frequencies with differences between and within species, and with temporal and geographical variations adding further complexity. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems can be deployed for long periods and can collect large volumes of data, becoming impractical for human operators to manually process due to the significant effort required. Many signal processing algorithms to automate this process have been produced with mixed results. Some are focused on the identification of single species while others handle a variety. No single algorithm is ideal for detecting and classifying all species concurrently, so any automated system requires a suite of these algorithms. A number of these algorithms are summarised here as part of an initial step in the construction of a PAM system incorporating real-time detection and classification.},

	abstract = {At least ten species of beaked whales inhabit the North Pacific, but little is known about their abundance, ecology, and behavior, as they are elusive and difficult to distinguish visually at sea. Six of these species produce known species-specific frequency modulated (FM) echolocation pulses: Baird’s, Blainville’s, Cuvier’s, Deraniyagala’s, Longman’s, and Stejneger’s beaked whales. Additionally, one described FM pulse (BWC) from Cross Seamount, Hawai’i, and three unknown FM pulse types (BW40, BW43, BW70) have been identified from almost 11 cumulative years of autonomous recordings at 24 sites throughout the North Pacific. Most sites had a dominant FM pulse type with other types being either absent or limited. There was not a strong seasonal influence on the occurrence of these signals at any site, but longer time series may reveal smaller, consistent fluctuations. Only the species producing BWC signals, detected throughout the Pacific Islands region, consistently showed a diel cycle with nocturnal foraging. By comparing stranding and sighting information with acoustic findings, we hypothesize that BWC signals are produced by ginkgo-toothed beaked whales. BW43 signal encounters were restricted to Southern California and may be produced by Perrin’s beaked whale, known only from Californian waters. BW70 signals were detected in the southern Gulf of California, which is prime habitat for Pygmy beaked whales. Hubb’s beaked whale may have produced the BW40 signals encountered off central and southern California; however, these signals were also recorded off Pearl and Hermes Reef and Wake Atoll, which are well south of their known range.},

Both recorders documented MFAS on 21 August 2011 before two Cuvier's beaked whales stranded on 22–23 August 2011. We compared the history of known naval operations and BW strandings from the Mariana Archipelago to consider potential threats to BW populations. Eight BW stranding events between June 2006 and January 2019 each included one to three animals. Half of these strandings occurred during or within 6 days after naval activities, and this co-occurrence is highly significant. We highlight strandings of individual BWs can be associated with ASW, and emphasize the value of ongoing passive acoustic monitoring, especially for beaked whales that are difficult to visually detect at sea. We strongly recommend more visual monitoring efforts, at sea and along coastlines, for stranded cetaceans before, during and after naval exercises.},

	abstract = {An acoustic survey of Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) was conducted off the U.S. West Coast in August and September 2016 using drifting recorder systems with a vertical array of two hydrophones at a depth of 110 m. Recorders were deployed 22 times to representatively cover a 1,058,000 km2 study area from the shelf break to 556 km offshore. Vertical angles to echolocation pulses were measured using the signal time-difference-of-arrival on the two hydrophones. Echolocation pulses of Cuvier's beaked whales were identified from their arrival angles (always from below the array) and unique acoustic characteristics. The density and abundance of Cuvier's beaked whales were estimated using a group-based point-transect analysis with 2 min time snapshots. The area effectively surveyed was estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood approach to fit the observed distribution of signal arrival angles. The acoustic availability of whales during their dive cycle was estimated from the duration of acoustic encounters using a mark-recapture approach. Overall, Cuvier's beaked whales were present during 0.60\% of snapshots, and their estimated average density is 5.12 animals per 1,000 km2 (CV = 0.27). Their estimated abundance in the study area is 5,454 individuals (95\% credibility intervals: 3,151 to 8,907).},

Significant overlap in call characteristics among many species, combined with a wide range of call types and acoustic behavior, makes classification of calls to species challenging. Here, we introduce {\textless}span{\textgreater}BANTER{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, a compound acoustic classification method for dolphins that utilizes information from all call types produced by dolphins rather than a single call type, as has been typical for acoustic classifiers. Output from the passive acoustic monitoring software, {\textless}span{\textgreater}PAMG{\textless}/span{\textgreater}uard, was used to create independent classifiers for whistles, echolocation clicks, and burst pulses, which were then merged into a final, compound classifier for each species. Classifiers for five species found in the California Current ecosystem were trained and tested using 153 single‐species acoustic events recorded during a 4.5 mo combined visual and acoustic shipboard cetacean survey off the west coast of the United States. Correct classification scores for individual species ranged from 71\% to 92\%, with an overall correct classification score of 84\% for all five species. The conceptual framework of this approach easily lends itself to other species and study areas as well as to noncetacean taxa.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A total of 107 vocalizations, including two variations of low-frequency downswept calls, were measured. Two of these calls were sweeps from 100 Hz to 44 Hz, over 1.0 seconds. The second call type (n=105) consisted of lowfrequency calls which swept from 39 Hz to 21 Hz over 1.3 seconds. These calls are different from sounds attributed to Sei whales in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans, where recordings were made only in the summer months. These sounds are similar, however, to sounds attributed to fin whales in Hawaiian waters. Additional studies are needed in order to understand the spatial and temporal variation in the vocal repertoire of Sei and Fin whales in the Pacific Ocean.},

Here, we explore the costs and benefits of these hunting transitions by combining high-resolution biologging data and DNA metabarcoding to quantify the relative contributions of aerial and ground prey to the total food intake of wild greater mouse-eared bats. We show that these bats use both foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures of 25 small, aerial insects and 30 large, ground-dwelling insects per bat, but with higher capture success in air (78 \% in air vs 30 \% on ground). However, owing to the 3 to 20 times heavier ground prey, 85 \% of the estimated nightly food acquisition comes from ground prey despite the 2.5 times higher failure rates. Further, we find that most bats use the same foraging strategy on a given night suggesting that bats adapt their hunting behaviour to weather and ground conditions. We conclude that prey switching matched to environmental dynamics plays a key role in covering the energy intake even in specialised predators.},

The remarkable similarity between the burrowing owl's defensive hiss and the rattlesnake's rattling reflects both exaptation and adaptation. Such exploitation of the rattling sound has favored alternations in both the structure and the deployment of rattling by rattlesnakes.},

	abstract = {Mitigation translocations are increasing and if they are to fulfill their regulatory intent, the application of best-practice principles to release strategy and monitoring is required. With an investment of 3 years, we engaged with stakeholders, including developers, to improve outcomes from mitigation translocations of an at-risk species, the western burrowing owl Athene cunicularia hypugaea (BUOW). We evaluated the consequences of two primary translocation methods, displacement (i.e. exclusion from burrow) and translocation, against control owls, using a suite of success metrics focused on dispersal, survival and reproduction. We also tested the provision of visual and acoustic conspecific cues to dampen dispersal away from release sites. Within the displaced group, BUOW settled closer to the origin site if burrows were available nearby. Although translocated BUOW dispersed farther from the release site than displaced BUOW, this difference disappeared when conspecific cues were present. BUOW were 20 times more likely to settle at the release site when conspecifics or their cues were present. Translocating animals over longer distances ({\textgreater}17.5 km) reduced the incidence of BUOW returning to the origin site. When avoiding direct impacts to BUOW is not feasible, a determination of the most beneficial translocation method must be made, driven by site-specific conditions and the feasibility of implementing best management practices. The known costs of translocation to survival may be offset by long-term advantages such as the establishment of breeding populations inside protected areas. Mitigation translocations can benefit from carefully devised and tested hypotheses to determine what works and what does not; we advocate the increased use of evidence in mitigation translocation to guide management decisions and policies.},

When cornered, burrowing owls produce a vocal hiss that has been suggested to mimic a rattlesnake's rattle. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment using two populations of Douglas ground squirrels that differ in their evolutionary histories with rattlesnakes. Both squirrel populations were sympatric with burrowing owls. Squirrels from a population subjected to natural selection by rattlesnakes treated the owl hiss as cautiously as they did the rattle, and responded with greater caution to the rattle and hiss than to two control sounds. Squirrels from a rattlesnake-free area, however, were less systematic in differentiating among the rattle, the hiss, and the control treatments. Such variation between ground-squirrel populations provides evidence that the burrowing owl's defensive hiss currently functions as an acoustic Batesian mimic of a rattlesnake's rattle.},

	abstract = {Owls play important cultural, ecological, and indicator roles throughout the world. Yet owls’ cryptic behavior has led to uncertainties about their basic ecology, including foraging, communication, and functional roles within the community, and potentially hindered the implementation of effective conservation measures. Here we demonstrate the potential for next-generation GPS tags capable of recording high-precision, minute-by-minute locations paired with other technologies to resolve some of these uncertainties. We combined high-precision GPS tagging data with infrared (IR) video recorded by arboreally-mounted cameras at 5 spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) nest sites in the Sierra Nevada, USA to provide a uniquely detailed examination of owl foraging patterns. Our approach allowed us to identify the precise time and location of 54 predation events and prey identity. We also used high-precision GPS tags with on-board audio recorders to map the vocal activity of 8 individuals by matching the time of vocalizations in the audio data to GPS locations recorded at one-minute intervals. The combined spatial and acoustic data revealed that nonbreeding males had the most widespread territorial vocal activity (i.e., producing 4-note territorial calls), while females provisioning fledglings displayed extensive nonterritorial vocal activity (i.e., producing many contact calls). Thus, the GPS-tag technologies we employed can provide opportunities to better understand owl foraging, communication, territoriality, and population dynamics. The methods we describe are time- and resource-intensive but can be paired with techniques that are more applicable at landscape scales, such as stable isotope analyses, LiDAR-based habitat analyses, and passive acoustic monitoring to link local processes to broad-scale ecological patterns. Therefore, our approach could be applied to many species whose behavior inhibits direct observation. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {In 2017, an endangered North Atlantic right whale mortality event in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, triggered the implementation of dynamic mitigation measures that required real-time information on whale distribution. Underwater glider-based acoustic monitoring offers a possible solution for collecting near real-time information but has many practical challenges including self-noise, energy restrictions, and computing capacity, as well as limited glider-to-shore data transfer bandwidth. This paper describes the development of a near real-time baleen whale acoustic monitoring glider system and its evaluation in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2018. Development focused on identifying and prioritizing important acoustic events and on sending contextual information to shore for human validation. The system performance was evaluated post-retrieval, then the trial was simulated using optimized parameters. Trial simulation evaluation revealed that the validated detections of right, fin, and blue whales produced by the system were all correct; the proportion of species occurrence missed varied depending on the timeframe considered. Glider-based near real-time monitoring can be an effective and reliable technique to inform dynamic mitigation strategies for species such as the North Atlantic right whale.},

	abstract = {Ocean gliders are quiet, buoyancy-driven, long-endurance, profiling autonomous platforms. Gliders therefore possess unique advantages as platforms for Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) of the marine environment. In this paper, we review available glider platforms and passive acoustic monitoring systems, and explore current and potential uses of passive acoustic monitoring-equipped gliders for the study of physical oceanography, biology, ecology and for regulatory purposes. We evaluate limiting factors for passive acoustic monitoring glider surveys, such as platform-generated and flow noise, weight, size and energy constraints, profiling ability and slow movement. Based on data from 34 passive acoustic monitoring glider missions, it was found that {\textless}13\% of the time spent at sea was unsuitable for passive acoustic monitoring measurements, either because of surface communications or glider manoeuvre, leaving the remainder available for subsequent analysis. To facilitate the broader use of passive acoustic monitoring gliders, we document best practices and include workarounds for the typical challenges of a passive acoustic monitoring glider mission. Three research priorities are also identified to improve future passive acoustic monitoring glider observations: 1) Technological developments to improve sensor integration and preserve glider endurance; 2) improved sampling methods and statistical analysis techniques to perform population density estimation from passive acoustic monitoring glider observations; and 3) calibration of the passive acoustic monitoring glider to record absolute noise levels, for anthropogenic noise monitoring. It is hoped this methodological review will assist glider users to broaden the observational capability of their instruments, and help researchers in related fields to deploy passive acoustic monitoring gliders in their studies.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to characterize the detection range of a near real-time baleen whale detection system, the digital acoustic monitoring instrument/low-frequency detection and classification system (DMON/LFDCS), equipped on a Slocum glider and a moored buoy. As a reference, a hydrophone array was deployed alongside the glider and buoy at a shallow-water site southwest of Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts, USA) over a four-week period in spring 2017. A call-by-call comparison between North Atlantic right whale upcalls localized with the array (n = 541) and those detected by the glider or buoy was used to estimate the detection function for each DMON/LFDCS platform. The probability of detection was influenced by range, ambient noise level, platform depth, detection process, review protocol, and calling rate. The conservative analysis of near real-time pitch tracks suggested that, under typical conditions, a 0.33 probability of detection of a single call occurred at 6.2 km for the buoy and 8.6–13.4 km for the glider (depending on glider depth), while a 0.10 probability of detection of a single call occurred at 14.4 m for the buoy and 22.6–27.5 km for the glider. Probability of detection is predicted to increase substantially at all ranges if more than one call is available for detection.},

	abstract = {Mitigating the effects of human activities on marine mammals often depends on monitoring animal occurrence over long time scales, large spatial scales, and in real time. Passive acoustics, particularly from autonomous vehicles, is a promising approach to meeting this need. We have previously developed the capability to record, detect, classify, and transmit to shore information about the tonal sounds of baleen whales in near real time from long-endurance ocean gliders. We have recently developed a protocol by which a human analyst reviews this information to determine the presence of marine mammals, and the results of this review are automatically posted to a publicly accessible website, sent directly to interested parties via email or text, and made available to stakeholders via a number of public and private digital applications. We evaluated the performance of this system during two 3.75-month Slocum glider deployments in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2015 and 2016. Near real-time detections of humpback, fin, sei, and North Atlantic right whales were compared to detections of these species from simultaneously recorded audio. Data from another 2016 glider deployment in the same area were also used to compare results between three different analysts to determine repeatability of results both among and within analysts. False detection (occurrence) rates on daily time scales were 0\% for all species. Daily missed detection rates ranged from 17 to 24\%. Agreement between two trained novice analysts and an experienced analyst was greater than 95\% for fin, sei, and right whales, while agreement was 83–89\% for humpback whales owing to the more subjective process for detecting this species. Our results indicate that the presence of baleen whales can be accurately determined using information about tonal sounds transmitted in near real-time from Slocum gliders. The system is being used operationally to monitor baleen whales in United States, Canadian, and Chilean waters, and has been particularly useful for monitoring the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale throughout the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the transit performance of state-of-the-art underwater vehicles and presents an intermediate-fidelity steady-state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance assessment of underwater vehicles. Focusing on the comparison of underwater gliders and propeller-driven AUVs, a simple glide metric is presented and the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders Slocum, Spray and Seaglider as well as propeller-modified versions thereof is evaluated. The evaluation is based on various data sets from wind tunnel tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) studies, and shows that for the respective hull shapes gliding locomotion proves more efficient in ideal conditions. However, biofouling conditions inflict a double penalty on glider performance, rendering gliders inferior to propeller-driven vehicles. The Slocum data set is used to validate a steady-state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance prediction. It is shown that even simplistic models based on semi-empirical and analytical expressions can be successfully used for design optimization through parametrization. Being computationally efficient, the model can be a useful tool for design engineers in early design phases. The model is used to evaluate the effects of wing span on gliding efficiency, indicating that the current design of the Slocum glider is near-optimal.},

	abstract = {High-resolution monitoring is fundamental to understand ecosystems dynamics in an era of global change and biodiversity declines. While real-time and automated monitoring of abiotic components has been possible for some time, monitoring biotic components—for example, individual behaviours and traits, and species abundance and distribution—is far more challenging. Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high-throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which can extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological communities via such technologies has primarily been achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within limited steps of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify and count multiple species, and record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve. Based on these rapidly developing technologies, we illustrate a solution to one of the greatest challenges in ecology: the ability to rapidly generate high-resolution, multidimensional and standardised data across complex ecologies.},

Direct comparisons to fixed recorders are necessary to evaluate these tools as passive acoustic monitoring platforms. One glider and two drifting deep-water floats were simultaneously deployed within a deep-water cabled hydrophone array to quantitatively assess their survey capabilities. The glider was able to follow a pre-defined track while float movement was somewhat unpredictable. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 20 Hz pulses were recorded by all hydrophones throughout the two-week deployment. Calls were identified using a template detector, which performed similarly across recorder types. The glider data contained up to 78\% fewer detections per hour due to increased low-frequency flow noise present during glider descents. The glider performed comparably to the floats and fixed recorders at coarser temporal scales; hourly and daily presence of detections did not vary by recorder type. Flow noise was related to glider speed through water and dive state. Glider speeds through water of 25 cm/s or less are suggested to minimize flow noise and the importance of glider ballasting, detector characterization, and normalization by effort when interpreting glider-collected data and applying it to marine mammal density estimation are discussed.},
