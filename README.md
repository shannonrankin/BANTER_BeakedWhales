***Abstract***

Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly used for assessing populations of marine mammals; however, analysis of large datasets is limited by our ability to easily classify sounds detected. Classification of beaked whale acoustic events, in particular, require evaluation of multiple lines of evidence by expert analysts. Here we present a highly automated approach to acoustic detection and classification using supervised machine learning and open source software methods. Data from four large scale surveys of beaked whales (North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Hawaii, and Eastern Pacific) were analyzed PAMGuard (acoustic detection), PAMpal (acoustic analysis) and BANTER (hierarchical random forest classifier). Overall correct classification results ranged from 86% for the South Atlantic data to 99% for the North Atlantic. Results for many species could likely be improved with increased sample sizes and consideration of alternative automated detectors. These methods provide a highly automated approach to acoustic detection and classification using open source methods that can be readily adopted for species and geographic regions.
