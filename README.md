The analysis directory contains:

![](images/blueFolderIcon-02.png) manuscript - Quarto (markdown) source
document for manuscript and supplement. Includes code to reproduce
figures generated by the analysis. Note that there are some relatively
minor manual modifications between the manuscript markdown and the final
submitted document. This folder include figures created for each of the
study areas (code to create those figures are in the relevant study area
folders).
